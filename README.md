# Terraform-Nots

Here I have wrote down all the required code , For Creating different -2 services in AWS cloud services 
You need to follow the same and new services will come up in AWS console , But be sure whenever you startany thing on cloud destroy as well when work is done else ready for paying unexpected huge amont of money.

So here I'm going to define from where you need to start 
1. AWS Configure in your cli whereever you are going to work
2. Once that is done be sure terraform is installed in ur system for chekin use terraform --help
3. Now write down ur terraform code somewhere I mean any text editor, after creat a new directory under that new file paste ur code here and save it with .tf exten
4. Commands 
     1. terraform init  , 
     2. terraform fmt   ,
     3. terraform validate  ,
     4. terraform plan    ,
     5. terrform apply    ,
      
5. Check in AWS console if everything was right it will create a new services 
6. Now delete that svc by using this command 
 6. terraform destroy
